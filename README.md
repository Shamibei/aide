# Text Generation with Flask, Eel, and Custom GPT

This project is a web application built using Flask and Eel to provide text generation functionality based on a custom-built GPT model. It has both a text-based and voice-based interface for generating text. The application uses a pre-trained PyTorch model and incorporates a voice module for interacting with the system via speech. 

## Features

- **Text Generation**: The application uses a custom-built GPT model for text generation.
- **Voice Interaction**: Users can interact with the app using voice commands through a voice module.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend is built using Flask, which serves both the HTML frontend and handles the generation logic.
- **Eel Frontend**: The frontend is powered by Eel, a Python library for building desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
